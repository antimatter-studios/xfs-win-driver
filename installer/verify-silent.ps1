.SYNOPSIS
  Assert that Setup.exe /quiet completes without a GUI prompt.

.DESCRIPTION
  winget reviewers run the bundle with /quiet during the unattended-install
  validation pass. If Burn's hyperlinkLicense theme blocks waiting for a
  click, validation fails with License-Blocks-Install /
  Validation-Unattended-Failed. This script catches that locally + in CI:

    1. Launches Setup.exe with /quiet /norestart under a hard timeout.
    2. Treats "still running past TimeoutSeconds" as a UI-blocked failure.
    3. Accepts exit 0 (success) or 3010 (reboot required) as PASS.
    4. Asserts xfs.exe is present at the expected install path.

  Side-effect: leaves xfs-win-driver + WinFsp installed on the host. Run on
  ephemeral CI runners or a Windows VM you don't mind dirtying.
