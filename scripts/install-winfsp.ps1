# Installs WinFsp from Chocolatey and fails unless it is actually installed.
#
# `choco install winfsp` exits 0 having installed nothing when the feed
# cannot serve the package ("Unable to find package 'winfsp'", "installed
# 0/0 packages"). The job then fails much later, in winfsp-sys's build
# script, with "WinFsp installation directory not found", which reads like a
# code problem (#20). This script retries a feed error, then looks for
# WinFsp exactly where winfsp-sys does -- the InstallDir value under
# HKLM\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\WinFsp or HKLM\SOFTWARE\WinFsp -- and fails the
# step itself when the headers are not there.
