# Working in xfs-win-driver (agent guide)

A Windows driver that mounts XFS volumes through WinFsp, over rust-fs-xfs. This file is the fast path for an agent picking up work here, so the
workflow does not have to be re-derived each time. It points at the existing
docs rather than duplicating them:

- **README** → what the driver does, how it is built and installed, and what
  does not work yet.
- **`chores.yml`** → every task, the sibling pins, and what each one runs.
- **`.github/workflows/`** → `ci.yml` gates a merge; `matrix.yml` mounts the
  driver through WinFsp on a Windows runner; `release.yml` builds the installer.

The section between the BEGIN/END markers below is **shared, byte-identical,
with every repository in this family**. Do not edit it here: change the
canonical copy in rust-fs-core and propagate it, or rust-fs-core's
`scripts/agents-core-check.sh` will fail. Everything after the END marker is
specific to this repository.

## Claiming work

Several agents work these repositories at the same time. Before you start on
an issue, claim it, so nobody else spends a session on what you are already
doing. The lock is a **GitHub label**, because labels are shared state that
every agent can read and change without posting comments into the thread.

**Before starting.** Check, claim, then read back:

```sh
gh issue view <N> --json labels                      # holds `claimed`? pick another
gh issue edit <N> --add-label claimed --add-label claim/<session>
gh issue view <N> --json labels                      # read back and confirm
```

`<session>` is your session name — `agent-<random4>-<isodate>`, e.g.
`agent-3f7c-2026-09-22`. Create the `claim/<session>` label if it does not
exist.

**Resolving a race.** Adding a label is not compare-and-swap: two agents can
both add `claimed` and both believe they won. That is what the read-back is
for. If it shows more than one `claim/*` label, the **lexically lowest**
session keeps the issue; every other agent removes its own `claim/*` label and
picks different work. Each racer computes the same answer independently, so no
further coordination is needed.

**When you finish or stop.** Remove both labels — on merge, or the moment you
abandon the work:

```sh
gh issue edit <N> --remove-label claimed --remove-label claim/<session>
```

Delete your `claim/<session>` label from the repository at the end of your
session so they do not accumulate.

**Reclaiming a stale claim.** An agent that dies holding a claim would block an
issue forever. If `claimed` was applied more than 12 hours ago and the holder's
branch has no commits since, any agent may take it: remove the stale `claim/*`,
add your own, and say so in the issue.

**This is a convention, not a fence.** Nothing enforces it. An agent that
ignores it duplicates work; it cannot corrupt anything. Honour it anyway.

## Work in a worktree

Every working copy is a **git worktree** of an existing checkout, made with
`git worktree add`. Never `git clone` a second, unlinked copy — not for a
branch, a PR, a review, or a sibling you need at another ref:

```sh
git -C <checkout> fetch origin
git -C <checkout> worktree add <path> -b <type>/<name> origin/main   # new work
git -C <checkout> worktree add --detach <path> <tag>                 # a sibling at a pinned ref
git -C <checkout> worktree remove <path>                             # when done
```

A worktree shares the checkout's objects and remotes, and `git worktree list`
shows it to every agent on the machine, so nobody else mistakes it for
abandoned work or loses track of it. An unlinked clone copies all the history
again, is invisible to that list, and gets left behind in `/tmp` long after the
work that made it is merged. Remove your worktree when you finish.

## Skills to use

- **`dev-loop`** — the required loop for any non-trivial change: baseline the
  full suite → change → re-run (no baseline test may regress) → enhance tests →
  vet. Always run it.
- **`commit`** / **`pr`** — for grouping commits and opening pull requests.

Each repository names any further skills of its own below.

## A bug fix starts with a red

**Prove it is broken first** — a failing check or test — *then* fix it, *then*
prove that same check is green, *then* confirm the full baseline still passes.
Never write the fix before you have a red. A fix with no failing test to its
name is a claim, not a result.

**Red and green happen in one pull request, on one branch.** Push the commit
that adds the failing test on its own, and let CI show it red on that pull
request. Then push the fix to the **same branch**, with the test untouched,
until the same pull request is green.

- Never put a fix in a second pull request, stacked or not. A pull request
  that only holds a red commit can never merge, and it blocks every pull
  request built on it.
- Never push the test and the fix together. The red has to be visible in CI,
  not claimed in the description.
- Wait for the red run to finish before pushing the fix: a new push cancels
  the run in progress.

## Nothing skips

A test that cannot run **fails**, naming the task that would provide what it
needed. Never add an early return for a missing fixture, tool or VM: a skipped
test reads exactly like a passing one, and a suite that quietly declines to run
is indistinguishable from a suite that passes.

Where a tier reports skips or ignored tests, that is a gate, not a note.

## Validate against something that is not us

A driver's own readers share its interpretation of the format, so they cannot
catch a misreading: the mistake is baked into the fixture *and* the parser, and
they agree with each other while disagreeing with every real filesystem. Unit
tests over self-built fixtures prove self-consistency, not correctness.

Every structure that is parsed or written gets a cross-validation test against
an **independent oracle** — the platform's own tools, a real kernel, or a third
implementation — before it is considered done. Each repository names its
oracles below.

## Output is budgeted

Test tiers run through `scripts/tier.sh`, which runs the suite **quietly**: the
whole run goes to `tmp/logs/<tier>.log`, a pass prints one verdict line naming
that log, and a failure prints the verdict, the command's status and the log's
path — `--tail N`, or `OUTPUT_BUDGET_FAIL_TAIL=N`, prints the tail for whoever
is watching. **Read the log**: a failing tier names it and does not recite it.
CI keeps the logs as an artifact, so the detail is always retrievable.

The budget caps the log, not merely what is shown, and every number in the
table was measured. A run that passes but prints more than its budget **fails**.

The reader who pays most for a noisy suite is an agent that re-reads its whole
transcript on every step, and so pays for one loud run many times over. If a
tier legitimately grows, raise its row **with the measurement that justifies
it**. Do not silence output to fit, and do not route around `tier.sh`.

## Commits and branches

- Branches are `<type>/<name>`, matching the commit type: `fix/`, `feat/`,
  `ci/`, `docs/`, `chore/`, `test/`.
- A commit is a subject plus flat one-sentence bullets. Subjects are
  declarative, not imperative: "the run-end bound is checked", not "check the
  run-end bound".
- **No AI attribution and no co-author trailers**, in commits or in pull
  request descriptions.
- `main` takes **squash merges only**.
- **Bring a branch up to date before every push.** `git fetch origin`, and
  if `main` has moved past the branch, rebase onto `origin/main` first,
  resolving any conflicts then, while they are small. Synced first, the run
  tests the branch close to how it will land. And a branch synced at every
  push never goes stale: each sync takes in only what landed since the last
  one, so conflicts stay few and small. Sync when you are pushing anyway; a
  push made only to bring a branch up to date buys a whole CI run and
  nothing else.
- **`main` merges through a merge queue.** A pull request whose own CI is
  green goes into the queue: `gh pr merge --squash` adds it. The queue tests
  each group on a temporary branch, `main` plus the queued pull requests in
  order, and squash-merges each one only when that run is green, so what
  lands is exactly the tree CI ran. That run is what "branches must be up to
  date" used to buy, at one run per group instead of one per pull request per
  merge: never update a branch only so that it can merge. Every workflow
  that gates `main` triggers on `merge_group`, or the queue never sees its
  result and nothing merges.

## Project rules

- **No GPL/LGPL/AGPL dependencies.** Permissive only (MIT/BSD/Apache).
  Shelling out to a copyleft CLI as a *test oracle* is fine — linking or
  copying it is not.
- **Each of these is a standalone project.** Never mention a consuming
  application in the README, the source, or CLI help.

## This repository

The independent oracles are Linux's: `mkfs.xfs` and the kernel build the fixture the `fixtures` job reads, and populated through a kernel mount (`scripts/build-fixtures.sh`). A read that only agrees with an image the driver made itself proves nothing.

`main` merges through a merge queue, and `ci-ok` is the one required check: it
needs every other job in `ci.yml` and accepts a skipped one only when the
change was documentation alone (rust-fs-core's `scripts/code-changed.sh`).
