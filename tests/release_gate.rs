//! A release is tested as a user installs it, and only then published;
//! winget follows on its own (#7).
//!
//! The matrix runs in CI since #8, but only against a development build,
//! and the release only checked that `Setup.exe /quiet` exits. So a tag
//! could attach an installer whose installed driver had never mounted an
//! image. These checks read the files as text; they need no Windows.
//! `matrix_in_ci.rs` covers the harness and the images.
//!
//! - The matrix is one reusable workflow, `matrix.yml`. CI calls it with a
//!   development build; given an installer, it installs it silently, runs
//!   the matrix against the `xfs.exe` the installer put in Program Files,
//!   then uninstalls it and checks nothing is left behind.
//! - The release calls it with the installer it just built, and attaches
//!   to the GitHub release only from a job that needs that run, with the
//!   manual checklist for the real-device check.
//! - A winget job, after the attach, submits the new version, and only
//!   when a token for it is configured.
